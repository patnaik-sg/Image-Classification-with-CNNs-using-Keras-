# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras-
I have built an Image Classifier with CNNs using Keras. The dataset which I have used is a subset of CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of nearly 10 different classes so I tried implementing them on the first three classes(i.e. Aeroplanes, Birds, Cars). I have achieved accuracy of 88% approx. In this CNN model I have used 3 CNN Layers. In addition I have also used EarlyStopping Callback so that if the training of the model goes in wrong way then it automatically stops after checking the validation accuracy at each step.
In the end I have also plotted the Training and validation accuracy for better understanding.
