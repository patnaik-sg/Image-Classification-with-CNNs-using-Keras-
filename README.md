# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras-
I have built an Image Classifier with CNNs using Keras. The dataset which I have used is a subset of CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of nearly 10 different classes so I tried implementing them on the first three classes(i.e. Aeroplanes, Birds, Cars). I have achieved accuracy of 88% approx. In this CNN model I have used 3 Layers.
